## Exercises

### Read Logs From Directory

Read logs from **/labs/1.2/\*.log** using **Logstash**. Once **Logstash** is monitoring for **/labs/1.2/\*.log**, copy all **\*.log** files from **/labs/1.2/copy** **to /labs/1.2**

??? tip "Solution"
    First, create a **Logstash** configuration file using the **Visual Studio Code Editor** to read the logs in **/var/log/**.

    ```bash
    code /labs/1.2/student/file.conf
    ```

    Next, enter the configuration needed to read **/var/log/** and output to the screen.

    ```javascript
    input {
    file {
      path => "/labs/1.2/*.log"
    }
    }

    output {
    stdout { codec => rubydebug }
    }
    ```

    !!! note
        By default, Logstash will monitor for changes to a file or directory. This means that if a log already existed in the directory before **Logstash** started, it will not read it. The exception to this is if the file is modified after **Logstash** is started. Because of this behavior, you are starting **Logstash** first, and then copying the log files into **/labs/1.2**.

    Save the file by either using **CTRL + S** or clicking **File -\> Save**. Then **close** out of **Visual Studio Code** by clicking the **X** in the top right corner.  

    ![](./media/image2.png)  

    ![](./media/image3.png)

    Next, run **Logstash** and tell it to use the **file.conf** configuration file you just created.  

    ```bash
    logstash -f /labs/1.2/student/file.conf
    ```

    !!! note
        The **-f** parameter tells Logstash which configuration file or file to load. In this example, only **file.conf** is loaded. However, **-f** can also be used to load all configuration files in a folder.

    You should see "**Pipelines running**" before continuing.  

    ```javascript
    [2018-05-21T02:44:29,404][INFO ][logstash.pipeline        ] Pipeline started succesfully {:pipeline_id=>"main", :thread=>"#<Thread:0x6229eb40 run>"}
    [2018-05-21T02:44:29,505][INFO ][logstash.agent           ] Pipelines running {:count=>1, :pipelines=>["main"]}
    ```

    Now open a **second terminal**.  

    ![](./media/image4.png)  

    The **second terminal** is going to be used to copy files to **/labs/1.2** while **Logstash** is running in another terminal. In the **second terminal**, run the command below.

    ```bash
    cp /labs/1.2/copy/*.log /labs/1.2/
    ```

    After a few seconds, **Logstash** will begin to process these logs. Switch back to your **original terminal,** and you should see logs like below.  

    ```javascript
    {
         "message" => "Single card detected",
        "@version" => "1",
            "path" => "/labs/1.2/gpu-manager.log",
            "host" => "logstash",
      "@timestamp" => 2018-05-21T02:49:57.402Z
    }
    ```

    This means that **Logstash** is properly monitoring **/labs/1.2/\*.log** for new logs. At this point, you can copy over any text file ending in **.log,** and **Logstash** will process it. Keep the **purple terminal** open as you will need it in further steps.  

    Back in the original terminal hit **CTRL + C** to stop Logstash.  

    ```javascript
    [2018-05-21T03:30:32,161][WARN ][logstash.runner          ] SIGINT received. Shutting down.
    [2018-05-21T03:30:32,600][INFO ][logstash.pipeline        ] Pipeline has terminated {:pipeline_id=>"main", :thread=>"#<Thread:0x4aeac31f run>"}
    ```

### Send Logs on UDP 1055

Send **/labs/1.2/auth.log** to **Logstash** over **UDP** port **1055**

??? tip "Solution"
    First, create a new configuration file called **udp1055.conf**. Do so by running the command below in any terminal.  

    ```bash
    code /labs/1.2/student/udp1055.conf
    ```

    Next, enter the configuration needed to listen on UDP port 1055 and output to the screen.

    ```javascript
    input {
      udp {
        port => 1055
      }
    }

    output {
      stdout { codec => rubydebug }
    }
    ```

    Save the file by either using **CTRL + S** or clicking **File -\> Save**. Then **close** out of **Visual Studio Code** by clicking the **X** in the top right corner.

    Next, run **Logstash** and tell it to use the **udp1055.conf** configuration file you just created.  

    ```bash
    logstash -f /labs/1.2/student/udp1055.conf
    ```

    If your configuration file is working, you should see "**Pipelines running**." At this point, **Logstash** is listening on UDP port 1055. Any data received over UDP port 1055 will be turned into a log. Normally, logs are sent over the network using either **Syslog** or a log agent such as **NXLog**. For this step, we will use **NXLog**.

    The **purple terminal** will be referred to as either the **Agent Terminal** or the **purple terminal**. The next steps are to be performed on the **Agent Terminal**. This is used to visually distinguish between **Logstash**, a log aggregator on the **black terminal**, and **NXLog**, a log agent on the **purple terminal**. Typically, **NXLog** would be run on a remote machine.

    Within the **Agent Terminal**, create an **NXLog** configuration file called **nxlog.conf**.

    ```bash
    code /labs/1.2/student/nxlog.conf
    ```

    Next, enter the configuration needed to send **auth.log** over UDP port 1055 to **Logstash**.  

    ```javascript
    <Input in>
      Module        im_file
      File          "/labs/1.2/auth.log"
      ReadFromLast  FALSE
      SavePos       FALSE
    </Input>

    <Output out>
      Module        om_udp
      Host      logstash
      Port      1055
    </Output>
    <Route 1>
      Path in => out
    </Route>
    ```

    Save the file by either using **CTRL + S** or clicking **File -\> Save**. Then **close** out of **Visual Studio Code** by clicking the **X** in the top right corner.

    In the **Agent Terminal,** run **nxlog-processor** and tell it to use the **nxlog.conf** configuration file you just created.  

    ```bash
    nxlog-processor -c /labs/1.2/student/nxlog.conf
    ```

    !!! note
        The **nxlog-processor** binary is used to process logs and then stop. It is used to invoke NXLog manually or for command line batch jobs. Normally, the **/etc/nxlog/nxlog.conf** file would be edited, and then the **NXLog** service would be restarted. The service would read the logs and then wait for additional changes.

    Back on the **black terminal,** you should have received logs sent from **NXLog**.  

    ```javascript
    {
           "message" => "May 20 18:10:14 ubuntu sudo: pam_unix(sudo:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)",
              "host" => "172.18.0.9",
        "@timestamp" => 2018-05-21T03:49:57.385Z,
          "@version" => "1"
    }
    ```

    While still on the **black terminal**, hit **CTRL + C** to stop
    **Logstash**.  

    ```javascript
    [2018-05-21T03:50:32,161][WARN ][logstash.runner          ] SIGINT received. Shutting down.
    [2018-05-21T03:50:32,600][INFO ][logstash.pipeline        ] Pipeline has terminated {:pipeline_id=>"main", :thread=>"#<Thread:0x4aeac31f run>"}
    ```

### Send Logs on TCP 1056

Send **/labs/1.2/auth.log** to **Logstash** over **TCP** port **1056**

??? tip "Solution"
    Perform these steps on the **black terminal**. First, create a new configuration file called **tcp1056.conf**.

    ```bash
    code /labs/1.2/student/tcp1056.conf
    ```

    Next, enter the configuration needed to listen on TCP port 1056 and output to the screen.  

    ```javascript
    input {
      tcp {
        port => 1056
      }
    }

    output {
      stdout { codec => rubydebug }
    }
    ```

    Save the file by either using **CTRL + S** or clicking **File -\> Save**. Then **close** out of **Visual Studio Code** by clicking the **X** in the top right corner.  

    Run **Logstash** and tell it to use the **tcp1056.conf** configuration file you just created.  

    ```bash
    logstash -f /labs/1.2/student/tcp1056.conf
    ```

    If your configuration file is working, you should see "**Pipelines running**." At this point, **Logstash** is listening on TCP port 1056.

    This time instead of using **NXLog** to send **auth.log** to Logstash, use **netcat**. This tool is built into many Linux operating systems and can be used to listening on a port or sending content over the network. Switch to the **Agent Terminal** and run the below command.

    ```bash
    nc 127.0.0.1 1056 -q 1 < /labs/1.2/auth.log
    ```

    This will grab the contents of **auth.log** and send them over TCP to port 1056. This would work whether it was done with **NXLog**, **netcat**, or even a scripting language like **PowerShell** or **Python**.

    Back in the **black terminal,** you should have received logs sent from **netcat** such as below.  

    ```javascript
    {
              "port" => 46356,
          "@version" => "1",
              "host" => "172.18.0.1",
           "message" => "May 20 19:34:21 ubuntu sudo: pam_unix(sudo:session): session closed for user root",
        "@timestamp" => 2018-05-21T03:25:35.989Z
    }
    ```

    While still on the **black terminal**, hit **CTRL + C** to stop **Logstash**.

### Send Logs to Storage

Send **/labs/1.2/auth.log** to **Elasticsearch**

??? tip "Solution"
    In the **black terminal**, create a new configuration file called **es.conf**.

    ```bash
    code /labs/1.2/student/es.conf
    ```

    The file will look like this:  

    ```javascript
    input {
      tcp {
        port => 1056
      }
    }

    output {
      elasticsearch { 
        hosts => "elasticsearch"
        index => "lab1.2"
     }
    }
    ```

    Save the file by either using **CTRL + S** or clicking **File -\> Save**. Then **close** out of **Visual Studio Code** by clicking the **X** in the top right corner.

    Run **Logstash** using the **es.conf** configuration file.  

    ```bash
    logstash -f /labs/1.2/student/es.conf
    ```

    You can confirm that Logstash is configured to send logs to **Elasticsearch** because, during start-up, it will display the following log message:  

    ```javascript
    [2018-05-21T03:28:35,581][INFO ][logstash.outputs.elasticsearch] New Elasticsearch output {:class=>"LogStash::Outputs::ElasticSearch", :hosts=>["//elasticsearch"]}
    ```

    Switch to the **Agent Terminal** and use **netcat** to send logs to Logstash using the command below. Because the output is sent to **Elasticsearch,** no logs will be seen from the terminal.

    ```bash
    nc 127.0.0.1 1056 -q 1 < /labs/1.2/auth.log
    ```

    !!! note
        The **-q 1** parameter tells **netcat** to quit one second after reaching the end-of-file (EOF) when sending a file.  

    You can tell when all logs have been sent as the command prompt will be presented again. You can now close out of the **Agent Terminal**. Switch to the **black terminal** hit **CTRL + C** to stop Logstash.  

    ```javascript
    [2018-05-21T03:32:32,161][WARN ][logstash.runner          ] SIGINT received. Shutting down.
    [2018-05-21T03:32:32,600][INFO ][logstash.pipeline        ] Pipeline has terminated {:pipeline_id=>"main", :thread=>"#<Thread:0x4aeac31f run>"}
    ```

### View Logs

View the logs within **Kibana**

??? tip "Solution"
    Open **Firefox** by **clicking** on the **Firefox** **icon** in the top left corner of your student VM.  

    ![](./media/image5.png)  

    If **Kibana** is not loaded, **click** on the **Kibana** bookmark in **Firefox**.

    ![](./media/image6.png)

    To see logs from a new index, you must tell **Kibana** about the index. To do this, **click** on **Management**.  

    ![](./media/image7.png)

    Next, **click** on **Index Patterns**.  

    ![](./media/image8.png)  

    Then **click** on **Create Index Pattern**.  

    ![](./media/image9.png)  

    In the **Index pattern** field, enter the index name of **lab1.2**. Then **click** on **Next step**.  

    ![](./media/image10.png)  

    Then select the **Time Filter field name** and **click** on **@timestamp** and **click** **Create index pattern**.  

    ![](./media/image11.png)  

    Now, you can switch back to the **Discover** tab by **clicking** on **Discover**.  

    ![](./media/image12.png)  

    Then select **lab1.2** as your index to view the logs.  

    ![](./media/image13.png)

    You should now see the logs you have collected.  

    ![](./media/image14.png)  

    !!! note
        If you cannot see any logs, it may be that the logs are older than the last 15 minutes. This is the default time span selected in **Kibana**. You can change this by clicking on the **date picker** in the top right corner. This will allow you to pick a longer period such as the **Last 5 years**.  

    ![](./media/image15.png)

    Now feel free to browse around the **Kibana** interface and look at the logs ingested. Once complete, you may close **Firefox** and all terminals.  

    !!! note
        Logs may be in Kibana, but they are not parsed. This makes it difficult to search for anything.
